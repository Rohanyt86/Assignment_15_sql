    "A primary key and a foreign key are both important concepts in database design and management:\n",

    "   - A primary key is a field or a combination of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each row or \n",
    "     record in that table.\n",
    "   - It enforces data integrity by ensuring that no two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "   - Typically, primary keys are used to link tables and establish relationships in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: In a \"Students\" table, the \"StudentID\" column can be the primary key because it uniquely identifies each \n",
    "            student.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "   - A foreign key is a field in a database table that is linked to the primary key of another table, creating a \n",
    "     relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "   - It is used to maintain referential integrity, ensuring that data in the foreign key column corresponds to data in \n",
    "     the primary key of the referenced table.\n",
    "   - Foreign keys are essential for creating relationships between tables in a relational database, such as connecting a \n",
    "    \"Students\" table to a \"Courses\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: In a \"Enrollments\" table, the \"StudentID\" column can be a foreign key that links to the \"StudentID\" in the\n",
    "            \"Students\" table, indicating which student is enrolled in which course.\n",
